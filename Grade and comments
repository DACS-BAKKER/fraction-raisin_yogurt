Elven and Alex

Code:

Looks good.  You undetstand classes well.
You do not need to use this so much, only use it if there is an ambiguity to resolve.
Some of your variable names are weak, like j and tl...
You do not seem to have a fraction variable, just a complex number...in faact you never use a fraction in your calculator. I do not understand that.
I think that was at the heart of the assignment, to make a fraction class and then use it in another class.

GUI:

Could you give some instructions, hard too use.
When I enter 1/2+3/4 I get 25/24 and that seems a bit off.  I am not even sure how you get that!
If I enter 1/2= +3/4= I get 13/24
1/2= +1/4 = leads to 5/8 . am I doing something wrong?
The complex part works, but it is hard to know what part of the number I am entering.  Can you prompt the user?
You communication with the user is minimal, you really just ask them to figure it out.

Grade:  check
Reasonable understanding of classes, but the GUI while perhaps functional leads to results that are uniterpretable to me.
